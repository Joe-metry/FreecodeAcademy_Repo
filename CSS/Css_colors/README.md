Creating a colour marker to help enhance colour combination skills:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

 When selecting colors for a webpage, it's important to consider not only the aesthetic
 appeal but also the accessibility of the colors. It's crucial to ensure that the colors
 you choose are readable for individuals with color vision deficiencies.

There are several ways to set color values in CSS, including using named colors,
hexadecimal codes, RGB values, and HSL values. Each method has its advantages and
disadvantages, so it's essential to understand them to choose the right one for your needs.

When pairing colors, you can use complementary, analogous, or triadic color schemes.
Complementary colors are opposite each other on the color wheel and provide high contrast,
while analogous colors are adjacent to each other and create a harmonious look.
Triadic color schemes use three colors that are equidistant on the color wheel and
provide a balanced look.

Overall, choosing the right colors for your webpage is an essential aspect of
web design that can greatly impact user experience.
